# Creating Message Templates

Your Message Templates will be reviewed to ensure they do not violate policies. Once approved, your business will have its own name where the Message Templates will live.

When creating a Message Temaple, you must have the following:

1. Message Template name
2. Translated Message Template in the correct format

### Examples

Creating a welcome message where the Message Template name is welcome and the message is

```
"Welcome {{1}}. We look forward to serving you." 
```

Creating an order confirmation message where the Message Template name is `order_confirmation` and the message is

```
"Your order {{1}} for a total of {{2}} is confirmed. The expected delivery is {{3}}." 
```
