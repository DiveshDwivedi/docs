# Whatsapp For Business API - Getting Started

Many of you are interested in WhatsApp Business and we totally get the point. WhatsApps approach to an API is a little bit more complicated than you’re used to.

First of all: WhatsApp doesn’t host the API themselves. This is a necessary step to ensure end-to-end encryption and making sure that no unencrypted messages flow through the WhatsApp servers.

To use the WhatsApp Business API you need a so called “Business Solution Provider” (BSP). Good news: We are one.

To get access to the WhatsApp Business API your company / use case must be approved by WhatsApp first. There are a few steps and details that you must complete before getting your access

## Step-1 Create a Facebook Business Manager ID

If you don’t have a Facebook Business Manager, you can create one here:

https://business.facebook.com

## Step-2 Verify your business

Everything you need to know is summarized in this article, created by Facebook

## Step-3  Get the WhatsApp Approval. (1 - 2 business days)

 We will create a WABA (WhatsApp Business Account) with the Facebook Business Manager ID provided.  


 IMPORTANT! The Facebook Business Manager ID MUST belong to the business that is asking for approval.

 If you’re an agency / developer and build an integration on behalf of your customer, we need the FBM ID of your customer, since they must be approved.

 Be aware that your use case must comply with the

  
  Business Policies: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/

  Commerce Policies: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/commerce-policy/

  Opt-In Requirements: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/Opt-In


## Step-4 : Give us permissions (< 5 minutes)

After you submitted your request we create the WABA. You will then receive a notification in your Facebook Business Manager, asking you for permission to send WhatsApp messages on your behalf.

https://business.facebook.com/settings/requests

Accept this request. As soon as you accepted the request and your Business Verification is done, WhatsApp will start the approval process.

Facebook also wrote an article about this topic. You can find it here

## Step 5: Waiting for approval

WhatsApp is now checking your application. When you comply with the business policies and commerce policies, you will be approved. After the approval, we will send you an email.

## Step-6: Activating a phone number (< 5 minutes)

As soon as steps 1 - 5 are complete, we can create the actual account and register a phone number. We can use a phone number that you own or provide you with a (german +49) phone number.

In case you want to use your own phone number, we have to coordinate and find a time to activate the account together.

If you want to use your own phone number:

You can use land line or mobile phone numbers. Your number must be able to receive either international SMS or international calls.

In case of voice activation: Your phone number may NOT be behind an IVR. The IVR needs to be deactivated for the activation call.

If you used WhatsApp on this number before, you must deactivate the account (not delete the app!) in the App via Settings - Account - Deactivate Account

You must send the activation code to us, after you receive it.


#### Congratulations! You can now use the WhatsApp Business API!
