# Webhook

The DLR Push API allows the delivery report of a sent message to be sent to the client's specified Webhook URL using the `POST` method  [create here](/developer/webhooks). You can create the Webhook URL by following the instructions below:

- Navigate to the Webhooks section and create a new Webhook.
- Upon creation, you will receive an `id` for the newly created Webhook.

To request delivery reports, include the `webhook_id` parameter and its corresponding value in your API Request. Once the request is made, you will receive the delivery report as shown below.

#### Example Webhook Request to your server

```

  curl -X POST \
  https://www.domain.com/ack/receive \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer %token%", \
  -d '{
      "id": "b34e35ad-fe34-4a8b-977c-b21cd76cd7d6:1",
      "mobile": "918921269xxx",
      "status": "DELIVRD",
      "credits": "2.0000",
      "units": 2,
      "deliv_time": "2021-04-09 16:27:51",
      "sent_time": "2021-04-09 16:27:35",
      "submit_time": "2021-04-09 16:27:39",
      "cid": "1234444XXXX",
      "custom": "9882XXXX",
    }'
```

- The response codes other than 200 or 202 are not taken into consideration and requests for such response codes are considered as failed.

- The method used for sending the delivery report onto the clientâ€™s URL is `POST`.

We try 3 times with interval of 30 minutes for failed requests. Continues failure requests will be ignored.
