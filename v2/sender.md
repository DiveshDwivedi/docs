# Sender ID

Sender ID is your identity from which the message is sent. For example, when you receive a general SMS from your friend, their name is displayed. Similarly, in case of Sender ID, the ID that you choose on the panel, or the one that is given to you, serves as your identity while sending messages. 

This SenderID will be used as often as possible but a major percentage of traffic will still be overwritten to ensure delivery: Due to recent regulation changes the alpha SenderID will be prefixed with 2 letters depending on which carrier was used to deliver the SMS to the final operator, or more commonly a random number; e.g. MD-XXXXXX (where XXXXXX is the registered SenderID).

### Sender ID format

**Promotional SMS** is numeric and fixed from the operator. For example 777777

**Transactional SMS** is 6 character, alphabetic in India,  example  NOTIFY, TXTSMS. 

### India SMS messaging regulations and restrictions

Several restrictions are in place regarding SMS messaging in India, particularly when it comes to the country’s National Do Not Call (NDNC) list (see more in the table below). There are other restrictions in place regarding sending times and volumes, which you can also see below.

Alternatively, read more at the [Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.](http://www.trai.gov.in/)

### National Do Not Call list (NDNC)

A substantial portion of mobile numbers are registered on the NDNC, and if you send marketing or promotional messages to these numbers, your message will be blocked (you can still send transactional and manually approved messages to these numbers).
It’s a good idea to check the NDNC by visiting [http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/search.misc](http://www.trai.gov.in/) to see if the number you want to send to is registered (remember to omit the international dialing prefix of 91 before searching).

### Time restriction

Promotional SMS messages may only be sent between 9am and 9pm standard India time. This means your messages could be blocked or delayed if you send outside of these times, depending on the operator.

### Volume restriction

You may not send more than six messages per hour with the same content, from the same sender, to the same number

### Restrictions on messages with stock-related information

Transactional routes cannot be used for sending any messages relating to stocks and/or shares. To use transactional routes for stock market activities, you’ll need to get certification from stock brokers and/or entities registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

#### The certification must follow the guidelines below:

1. Certification must be written on the entity’s company letterhead.
2. The entity should be registered with SEBI.
3. Entity should mention the command line interfaces (CLIs) to be used by them and the nature of the messages/content to be used.
4. Purchase order validity.

### Restrictions on opt-in messages
- No opt-in messages should be sent via transactional routes.
- An opt-in message can be sent to the end user only if s/he has submitted a documented approval.
- Web opt-ins are not accepted as approved opt-ins.

### Restriction on social invites

Any invitations related to social media/websites/OTTs need to have their content confirmed and whitelisted prior to being sent via transactional accounts, and violating this can result in heavy fines.
