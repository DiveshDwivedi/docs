# Sender ID

Sender ID is your identity from which the message is sent. For example, when you receive a general SMS from your friend, their name is displayed. Similarly, in case of Sender ID, the ID that you choose on the panel, or the one that is given to you, serves as your identity while sending messages. 

This SenderID will be used as often as possible but a major percentage of traffic will still be overwritten to ensure delivery: Due to recent regulation changes the alpha SenderID will be prefixed with 2 letters depending on which carrier was used to deliver the SMS to the final operator, or more commonly a random number; e.g. MD-XXXXXX (where XXXXXX is the registered SenderID).

Sender ID for **Promotional SMS** is numeric and fixed from the operator. For example 777777
Sender ID for **Transactional SMS** is 6 character, alphabetic in India,  example  NOTIFY, TXTSMS.
