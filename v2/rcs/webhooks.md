# Webhooks

Webhooks are customizable HTTP callbacks that are defined by the user and triggered by specific events. When the designated trigger event takes place, the RCS API client detects the event, gathers the relevant data, and promptly sends a notification (in the form of an HTTP request) to the Webhook URL specified in the application settings. This notification serves to update the status of sent messages or inform you when a new message is received.

> It is crucial to ensure that your Webhook returns an HTTPS 2xx OK response when receiving notifications. If the response is not received or does not meet the required criteria, the RCS API client interprets it as a failed notification and attempts to resend it after a certain delay.

## Retrying failed webhooks

If the webhook fails to send a response with a 2xx status code, or if the remote app does not respond within 3 seconds, the package considers the call as failed. In such cases, we will make two additional attempts to send the webhook call.

To avoid overwhelming the remote app, we introduce a delay between each retry attempt. By default, we wait 10 seconds between the first and second attempt, 100 seconds between the third and fourth attempt, 1000 seconds between the fourth and fifth attempt, and so on. The maximum wait time is set at 100,000 seconds, equivalent to approximately 27 hours. This ensures that we do not excessively burden the remote app while allowing for reasonable retry intervals.

## Signature

If you wish to have your callbacks signed and have made the proper configuration for this, the callbacks will have the following signature-related headers.

| Name      | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signature | The signature generated by system with webhook id as secret |
