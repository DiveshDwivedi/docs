# IP Whitelisting

IP whitelisting enables the creation of lists consisting of trusted IP addresses or IP ranges that have access to API Tokens. This security feature is commonly employed to restrict and regulate access exclusively to trusted users.

### How to Enable IP Whitelisting

IP whitelisting can be enabled while creating access-token in your account.

* Step 1 : Login to your account and click on Manage on your side bar.
* step 2 : click on API keys option and the API creation page will be opened for you.
* step 3 : You have to click on "create new token" and the creation of token page opens where you will have to enter the Ip address ( Multiples seperated by ,) which you  would like to whitelist.
* step 4 : Click on create and the IP whitelisting is done and that access-token works only in that ip address.
