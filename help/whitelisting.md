# IP Whitelisting

IP whitelisting allows you to create lists of trusted IP addresses or IP ranges from which API Tokens can be accessed. IP whitelist is a security feature often used for limiting and controlling access only to trusted users.

### How to Enable IP Whitelisting

IP whitelisting can be enabled while creating access-token in your account.

* Step 1 : Login to your account and click on Manage on your side bar.
* step 2 : click on API keys option and the Api creation page will be opened for you.
* step 3 : You have to click on "create new token" and the creation of token page opens where you will have to enter the Ip address ( Multiples seperated by ,) which you  would like to whitelist.
* step 4 : Click on create and the IP whitelisting is done and that access-token works only in that ip address.
