# Default Country Prefix

The "default country prefix" feature allows you to set a default country code for your profile. This feature simplifies communication by automatically adding the country code to all phone numbers associated with the user's account.

It is particularly valuable for bulk campaigns, where users deal with a list of phone numbers from same country, as it saves time, reduces errors, and ensures effective communication.

With our feature, you also have the flexibility to override the default country code when needed.
