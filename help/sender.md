# Sender ID

The Sender ID serves as your identity when sending messages. According to TRAI regulations, all application-to-people SMSs should be sent using a Sender ID rather than a number. The SMS Sender ID is the name that appears as the sender of your outgoing transactional SMS messages. It provides an excellent opportunity to reinforce your brand identity with your customers.

Similar to how you receive general SMS messages from your friends with their names displayed, the Sender ID chosen on the panel or provided to you serves as your identity when sending messages.

While the chosen Sender ID will be used as frequently as possible, it's important to note that a significant portion of traffic will still be overwritten to ensure successful delivery. Recent regulation changes require the alpha Sender ID to be prefixed with two letters, depending on the carrier used for delivering the SMS to the final operator. In some cases, a random number may be added as well. For example, the registered Sender ID "MD" may appear as "MD-XXXXXX" (where XXXXXX represents the registered Sender ID).

### Sender ID format

**Promotional SMS** is numeric and fixed from the operator. For example 777777

**Transactional SMS** is 6 character, alphabetic in India,  example  NOTIFY, TXTSMS. 

### Don'ts:

* Do not choose commonly used English words or phrases like "COFFEE" or "SMSFRU"
* Do not use other company names or brands like "AIRTEL" or "LENOVO"'
* Do not violate someone else's trademark
* Avoid using numbers unless it is necessary and supports (as it looks spammy). For ex: Avoid "BUY431".'

### Do's:

* It must be 6 characters long (mandated by TRAI. Don't ask us why)
* It is always capitalized
* It must be reflective of your brand name and/or trademark.
* It must tie in well with the content in the SMS. It could be campaign specific.

Let's say for some reason your entered a sender ID while purchasing a number and now you want to change it. Here's what you need to do:

* You can't make any alteration to the existing SenderID.
* You have to apply for a new Sender ID.
* For this you have to create a new Sender ID from your respective SMS panel
Login into your account > Manage Items > Sender ID > Create Sender ID
* After applying, you'll get an approval from our support team.

### India SMS messaging regulations and restrictions

Several restrictions are in place regarding SMS messaging in India, particularly when it comes to the country's National Do Not Call (NDNC) list (see more in the table below). There are other restrictions in place regarding sending times and volumes, which you can also see below.

Alternatively, read more at the [Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.](http://www.trai.gov.in/)

### National Do Not Call list (NDNC)

A substantial portion of mobile numbers are registered on the NDNC, and if you send marketing or promotional messages to these numbers, your message will be blocked (you can still send transactional and manually approved messages to these numbers).
It's a good idea to check the NDNC by visiting [http://www.nccptrai.gov.in/nccpregistry/search.misc](http://www.trai.gov.in/) to see if the number you want to send to is registered (remember to omit the international dialing prefix of 91 before searching).

### Time restriction

Promotional SMS messages may only be sent between 9am and 9pm standard India time. This means your messages could be blocked or delayed if you send outside of these times, depending on the operator.

### Volume restriction

You may not send more than six messages per hour with the same content, from the same sender, to the same number

### Restrictions on messages with stock-related information

Transactional routes cannot be used for sending any messages relating to stocks and/or shares. To use transactional routes for stock market activities, you'll need to get certification from stock brokers and/or entities registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

#### The certification must follow the guidelines below:

1. Certification must be written on the entity's company letterhead.
2. The entity should be registered with SEBI.
3. Entity should mention the command line interfaces (CLIs) to be used by them and the nature of the messages/content to be used.
4. Purchase order validity.

### Restrictions on opt-in messages
- No opt-in messages should be sent via transactional routes.
- An opt-in message can be sent to the end user only if s/he has submitted a documented approval.
- Web opt-ins are not accepted as approved opt-ins.

### Restriction on social invites

Any invitations related to social media/websites/OTTs need to have their content confirmed and whitelisted prior to being sent via transactional accounts, and violating this can result in heavy fines.
